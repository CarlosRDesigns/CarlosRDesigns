<!--Random shit down below that I'm working on

<div class="block-goals">
    <h2>I have 3 goals when I'm working with a team</h2>
    <p>I work as collaboratively as possible, I'm strategic in my focus and I stay observant of the project landscape and feedback I'm receiving.</p>

<div class="block-background">
    <h2>My background</h2>
    <p>I've been a designer for nearly 15 years focusing on visual design/UI, UX and overall design strategy. Throughout my career I've been able to work with companies like Microsoft, Cisco, Amazon Web Services (AWS), T-Mobile and Toyo Tires.</p>

    <p>I'm a Designer with a strategic focus, but I still setting type and building color palettes.&#127912</p>

    <p>I’ve learned that flexibility and communication are key, not only to a project's success, but my own success as well. I pride myself on being able to work side-by-side with other team members, from C-level execs to developers.</p>

    <p>While my main focus is on UX and UI design, the last few years have given me the opportunity to tackle more strategic problems and focus on information architecture, product management and work on the overall strategy of a given product.</p>
    
    <p>Right now I'm heading up a team that's working to establish a &#127912 <strong>Design System</strong> &#128736 at a large UK charity. It's a huge task and there's so much change coming for the organization (from tech stacks to organizational changes) but it's really exciting and I'm loving the challenge.</p>
