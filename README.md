- 👋 Hi, I’m Carlos. I'm here to create my portfolio!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... design, code, cars, music and DJ'ing (not particularly in that order).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on upgrading my HTML / CSS skills and maybe even learn some React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not a whole lot at the moment
- 📫 How to reach me on Twitter at @CarlosRDesigns1
